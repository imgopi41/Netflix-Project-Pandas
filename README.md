**I. Descirption**

This is simple Netflix Dataset implemented using Python Pandas and Seaborn. In this project i have done Basic Analysis on the given dataset, 
Project is implemented on Jupyter Notebook.


**II. Technology Stack**

Language: Python

IDE used: Jupyter Notebook


**III. Objective**

Task 1: Checking and removing Duplicate value in the dataset

Task 2: Checking and removing Null values in the dataset

Task 3: Showing null values with heat-map

**Questions**

Q1. For "House of Cards" , What is showid & who is the director of the show?

Q2. How many movies & tv shows are in the dataset ?

Q3. Show the titles and Tv shows that were released in India only.

Q6. In how many Movies and Tv shows Tom Cruise was cast ?

Q7. What are the different Ratings defined by Netflix

Q8. How many Movies Got TV-14 rating in Canada ?

Q9. What is the Maximum duration of Movie/Show on Netflix ?

**IV. Things i have Worked on:**

**Libraries used in Python**

1. Pandas
2. Seaborn

**Funtions used in this Project**

1. head()
2. tail()
3. shape
4. size
5. columns
6. dtypes
7. info()
8. value_counts()
9. unique()
10. nunique()
11. duplicate()
12. isnull()
13. dropna()
14. isin()
15. str.contains()
16. groupby()
17. countplot()
18. max()

**V. Procedures:**

**Data Gathering :**

Imported CSV file to excel. Performed various activities, And Also transformed the data into a format that can be easily analyzed.

**Data Visualization:**

Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data. By using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data 
visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data. Similarly in this project we 
have used Visual representation by using Seaborn Library, Displaying the null values in our dataset we used Heat-Map. which displays the 
number of null values in each column, Where in the given dataset Director column has more number of null values. 


**VI. Demo:**

**VII. Applications & Future enhancements:**

This is an Interactive reports on Netflix dataset. This is kind Analysis is done to check and fetch the patricular details in the given 
data. And also representing the data in visual form which brings cilents a clear idea on project. This is complete beginners project, The 
one who is cures to be part of Data Analysis this is absolutely for those who are likely want to learn python for Data Analysis.
